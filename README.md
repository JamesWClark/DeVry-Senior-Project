DeVry-Senior-Project
====================

i thought i lost it, but here it is - to the best of my knowledge - our senior project source code

note, in our original implementation, someone (me) came up with the wise idea of using machine config to connect to a remote sql server membership database on our web server. obviously, this belongs in the web.config. unfortunately, that machine.config no longer exists. therefore, to get this app actually running again, one would need to configure a sql server membership db and rebuild this web.config. 

realistically and mainly, this is just a preserved example of what not to do. it was a great experience learning about page lifecycle, sql server, and web hosting.
